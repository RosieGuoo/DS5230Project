Streaming Success Unleashed: Decoding the Strategies of Top Twitch Influencers

Our team is composed of two members, Ruonan Ji and Rosie Guo. We are both keen on engaging in a hands-on project to enhance our practical skills and apply our theoretical knowledge in a real-world context.
Problem description

The Esports and game streaming industry has witnessed substantial growth, with Twitch being a predominant platform hosting millions of viewers daily. However, the path to becoming a successful streamer is nuanced and multifaceted. This project aims to identify and formalize the patterns and strategies adopted by successful Twitch streamers.
The inputs are a dataset of the top 1000 Twitch streamers, including metrics such as watch time, stream time, peak and average viewers, followers gained, views gained, partnered status, content maturity, and language.
The outputs would be success blueprints, which are sets of characteristics, behaviors, and strategies common among successful streamers.
The problem is interesting as it combines clustering and association rule mining to provide a comprehensive and actionable guide for aspiring streamers, while also offering insights for platform providers and investors in the Esports industry. This helps in suggesting new streamers to viewers, guiding streamers on how to improve, and connecting them with suitable advertisers.
